        <p> I initially missed the part about how this website was supposed to be about a mythical animal,<br>
            so here is a picture of a unicorn
        </p>

        <p>
            Unicorns look very similar to the non-mythical animal the horse.<br>
            Unicorns, however, have an elegant horn protruding from their forhead,<br>
            and are capable of casting vast amounts of magic.<br>
